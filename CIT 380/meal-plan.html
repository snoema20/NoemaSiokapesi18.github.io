        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          Path B allows for students to still gain experience in becoming more
          proactive, but with more scaffolding to help them get started. They
          are given examples and ideas to help scaffold their project planning
          around. These projects can be completed as a group or individually.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong
            >If done individually a Plan B student can get a maximum of 85%. If
            done as a group the maximum grade is 95%</strong

        </p>
        <p>
          After settling on a project to complete you should then put some
          research and thought towards which Project management methodology
          would best fit with your project plans. Google is your friend here, or
          here is a
          <a

            target="_blank"
            >sample list</a
          >
          to get you started.
        </p>
        <p>
          Methodology in hand, you should now prepare the Charter for your
          project and the project management plan. Your documentation list might
          change slightly based on your methodology, but your deliverable list
          should include most of the following parts:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Project Charter</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Project Management Plan</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Scope Management Plan</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Schedule Management Plan</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Quality Management Plan</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Risk Management plan</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Communications Plan</strong> (if done as a group)</li>
          <li>
            <strong>Human Resources Management Plan</strong>: (if done as a
            group)
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          This list is somewhat open for negotiation. You can omit or add to it
          provided you support your changes with good rationale.
        </p>
        <p>
          There will be a requirement for you to turn in a mid-project milestone
          report detailing your progress at the midpoint of your project, and a
          lessons learned report you will turn in at the end. The milestone
          report must be done no later than Week 6, the lessons learned report
          no later than week 12. Both of these can be completed much earlier if
          you are trying to finish the course early or are completing multiple
          projects.
        </p>

        <p>
          These status reports should be submitted to the
          <strong>Project Milestone Reports</strong> discussion board in ILearn.
          Include any important project documentation or other artifacts that
          will be needed to understand the full status of your project along
          with your milestone report.
        </p>
        <p>
          You get to have some control over the quality management for the
          project, including how the success of your project will be measured
          (your grade). The PMBOK has some ideas for this, but here are some
          additional ideas to look through as you put your plan together:
        </p>
        <pre><code><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zSaYwOyC84QY4R6I15z5PHPP0ZqrKEynLmY5bQdu0UU/edit?usp=sharingâ€©" target="_blank">CIT 380 Evaluation methods</a></code></pre>
        <p>
          All changes to the plan should be discussed and ultimately approved by
          the instructor.
        </p>

        <h2>Additional information</h2>
        <p>
          A Project Management Plan (PMP) is a living document. Once you have
          completed yours make sure to regularly update it as necessary while
          you execute the project.
        </p>
        <p>
          There will also be an expectation for you to review other student's
          projects. You can evaluate the projects either at the half-way point
          using the milestone mid-project report, or at the end using the
          lessons learned.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can determine the format of this review, or you can look at common
          project post-mortem templates.
        </p>
        <p>
          Start early on these reviews. Early feedback to the owners of the
          projects will be much more useful than late feedback. Likewise you
          should seek out early feedback on your project. Because of the way the
          course is structured there is no guarantee that your project will get
          reviewed by a peer. You can seek these out! From classmates, family,
          co-workers, instructors, peers, etc.
        </p>
        <p>
          The projects to review will be found in the
          <strong>Project Milestone Reports</strong> discussion board in ILearn.
          Post your review or post-mortem as a reply in that same place.
