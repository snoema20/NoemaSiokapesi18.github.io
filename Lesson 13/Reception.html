            <p>Marriage! What a glorious adventure! We congratulate all those who have found their companions and want to be

                sealed to them for time and all eternity. We encourage all engaged couples to search for the place in which

                they wish to be sealed together for time and all eternity. Our hotel offers many services for newly wed couples,

                either for those who get married in the temple or not. All guests at our hotels have access to our wedding

                reception and food catering services.</p>

            <p>We work with a number of restaurants in the surrounding areas to help cater such glorious receptions. We offer

                special deals to those who stay at our hotel during their wedding and any family members that they recommend

                to stay with us. We have a great number of rooms available for the wedding reception, with each room having

                a different style, so that the bride and groom and match their reception with their wedding theme.</p>

            <p>After the reception is over, there is no need to worry about cleaning up! Just grab whatever it is that you brought

                and that you want to keep, and our hotel employees will clean everything up for you! We do our best to make

                your stay with us as easy as possible, and your wedding day as special as we can.</p>
